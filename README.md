# Automatic-Vehicle-Monitoring-System
## Description

This project integrates technologies to create an advanced vehicle safety system. The primary components include the MPU6050 gyroscope and acceleration sensor for six-axis motion tracking, a GPS module for accident location extraction and upload to a cloud platform, and a NodeMCU microcontroller. Additionally, the system incorporates drowsiness detection using a shape predictor with 68 face landmarks.
